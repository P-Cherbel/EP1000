        <h2> 3 Running lights</h2>
        <p >One of the arduino assignments was to create a board with 3 lights</p> 
       
        <p>The lights in my simulation are "chasing" each other, fading in and out.</p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <h3>Get the right components</h3> 
      <p>To start off, in tinkercad, select:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An arduino board</li>
        <li>A breadboard</li>
        <li> 3 LED lights </li>
        <li> 3 220Ohm resistors </li>
    </ul>
      <img src="Pictures/3f_components.png" width="600px"/>    
        <h3>Set up the connections</h3>
      <p>Connect the breadboard to the arduino board by connecting the 5V pin and GND pin to the live and ground of the breadboard,respectively.    </p>
      <p>Place the LEDs on the breadboard side by side and connect a resistor to the negative side of each LED.</p>
      <p>Connect the positive side of the LEDs to pins 9, 10 and 11.</p>
      <img src="Pictures/3f_circuit.png" width="600px"/> 

      <h3>Code!</h3>
      <p>Firstly, define animationSpeed and brightness. Then in voidsetup, make the pins 9, 10 and 11 outputs.    </p>
      <p>Next for the voidloop, set the animationSpeed to 3.</p>
      <p>To make the LEDs fades in write the command "for (Brightness = 0; Brightness <= 255; Brightness += 1)" (255 to 0 for fading out) and since fading is analog, write"
        analogWrite(11, Brightness)". </p>
        <p> Since I wanted to have the lights "chase" each other, I added a line to turn off pin 9 after fading out of pin 11, off 11 after 10 and 10 after 9.</p>
               
      <h2>Tip</h2>
      <p>Copy paste the lines for each pin to minimise any errors since you check the same code 3 times.</p>


      <h2> Light with button</h2>
        <p >The second arduino assignment was to create a light with a button</p> 
       
        <p>The lights in my simulation are "chasing" each other, fading in and out.</p>
